## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb Seattle data from 2016 on Kaggle to better understand:


1 How does the occupancy rate change during the record window?

2 How does the price change during the record window?

3 Are the trends of average price and occupancy rate the same?

4 Using machine learning technique to predict the listing prices.




## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook and 2 datasets available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rujunying/when-is-the-best-time-of-booking-airbnb-in-seattle-b4bc3f306e4a?postPublishedType=initial).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
